## Branching & PR Workflow

We follow a simple Git flow:

- Always branch off `dev`.
- Use the following branch naming convention:
  - `feature/short-description`
  - `bugfix/short-description`
  - `hotfix/short-description`

**Examples:**
- `feature/connect-homepage-api`
- `bugfix/fix-navbar-hover`

### Opening a Pull Request (PR)

1. Push your feature branch.
2. Open a PR targeting the `dev` branch.
3. Fill out the PR template (auto-filled when opening a PR).
4. Assign a reviewer.
5. Address feedback, then merge when approved.

âœ… Keep PRs small and focused (<300 lines ideally).
âœ… Always test locally before opening a PR.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Follow the established coding patterns (TypeScript, Tailwind conventions).
- Reuse components wherever possible.
- Keep commits and PRs focused on one feature or fix at a time.
- Communicate blockers early.
